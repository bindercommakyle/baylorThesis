\renewcommand{\thesisAbstract}{For dynamical systems with the shadowing property,
the omega-limit sets can be characterized by a condition of internal chain transitivity.
In this thesis, we
define four limit sets in the case of finitely-generated free group and monoid actions. We
give a characterization for two of these limit sets in terms of a kind of internal 
transitivity under the condition that the group or monoid action has an asymptotic
shadowing property.}
